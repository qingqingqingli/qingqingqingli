### Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm Qing and currently learning about software engineering at [Codam](https://www.codam.nl/en/) (part of [42 network](https://www.codam.nl/en/the-42-network)).

Prior to Codam, I worked as a political journalist (in China), travel consultant (in the Maldives), marketing and customer experience consultant (in The Netherlands) and etc. Learning about programming has transformed my skillsets and introduced me to a fascinating tech world. 

I post all projects I completed at Codam and other personal projects here. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out.
